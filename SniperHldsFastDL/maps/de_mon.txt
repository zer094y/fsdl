Map Created by MaMuS
----------------

A terorrist group is preparing to invade the Hurgland Natural park.
Their intention is to destroy the ancient fortress or the great
lighthouse using C4 explosives, in retaliation to Lord Hurg beco-
ming the new president. 

The counter-terrorist team is en route to intercept the terrorists
and eliminate the threat. 

In this map you will be presnted with a large amount of land
 - with exotic terrain and beautiful beaches. Watch out for enemies
in all directions - it's quite easy to get hit by an AWP shot! 

Plan your tactics well, this map was designed to put the player
in some awkware situations. This is not a normal map - so spend
some time getting used to it. 

OBS1: Type "r_detailtextures 1" to activate the detail textures! 
OBS2: Feel Free to find the easter eggs! They're very cool.
