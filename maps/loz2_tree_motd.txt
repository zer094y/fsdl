Inside The Deku Tree
-----------------------------------------

Hints/Information:

-To break the web in the first room, at least two
players need to jump off separate ledges (3 at the 
top). Make sure you don't land on each other!

-Deku Babas that stand straight up can be killed for Deku
Sticks. Use these to light torches and burn webs.

-You can't kill Deku Scrubs with a melee
weapon. You need Deku Nuts or a Slingshot.

-It takes two players to take down a Big Skulltula. 
One to distract, and another to attack.

-Gohma eggs can be broken before they hatch.

-Gohma's only weakpoint is the eye.

-Once you run out of lives, you have to restart
the level (if the majority wants to try again).

-Boulders and certain walls can only be blown up
with Deku Nuts.

-There is a hidden chest holding 10 lives somewhere.
