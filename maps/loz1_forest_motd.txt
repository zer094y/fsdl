Kokiri Forest
-----------------------------------------

Hints/Information:

-Before entering the Deku Tree, you should get more 
lives and items. 

-You can get extra lives at the fairy fountain.

-Lives, rupees, and items carry over to the next level.

-You can't kill Deku Scrubs with a melee
weapon. You need Deku Nuts or a Slingshot.

-Once you run out of lives, you have to restart
the level (if the majority wants to try again).

-Boulders and certain walls can only be blown up
with Deku Nuts.

-There are enough rupees in the level to buy all of
the items in the shop (you can't buy arrows, though).
